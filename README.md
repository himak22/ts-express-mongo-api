# Project Name: REST API with Node, Express, TypeScript, and MongoDB + Authentication

## Overview
This project is a robust RESTful API built using Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript, and MongoDB. It incorporates authentication mechanisms to ensure secure access to endpoints. Whether you're starting a new project or looking to enhance an existing one, this API provides a solid foundation for managing data and user authentication.

## Features
- **Node.js**: Utilizes the powerful capabilities of Node.js for server-side development.
- **Express.js**: Implements the Express.js framework to handle routing and middleware.
- **TypeScript**: Enhances code maintainability and scalability with static typing and modern JavaScript features.
- **MongoDB**: Integrates MongoDB as the database for efficient data storage and retrieval.
- **Authentication**: Implements authentication mechanisms to secure endpoints and manage user access.
